    "text": "NetSky AI was founded in October of 2024 with a singular vision: to make email an effortlessly productive experience for everyone. In a world overflowing with information and tasks, we believe your inbox should help—not hinder—your workflow. With NetSky AI, we’re building an intuitive AI assistant that tackles the mundane, repetitive tasks, freeing up your time for what truly matters.\n\n\n\nNetSky AI began as a shared vision between two Rice University classmates, Cody and Dylan, who reconnected years after their undergraduate days. By 2023, both were deeply involved in the world of large language models (LLMs). Dylan was leading compute resources and financial strategy for Amazon’s AGI division, while Cody was at Voltron Data, creating tools to help users harness the power of LLMs with their data, and previously in Microsoft’s Azure AI division, empowering developers to reach the future of AI through their MLOps journey.\nAs they exchanged stories from their careers, Cody and Dylan recognized a gap in how AI was applied to everyday productivity tools, especially for non-technical users. Many advanced AI capabilities remained locked behind complex interfaces, out of reach for people who could benefit the most from them. Fueled by this insight and their shared entrepreneurial spark, Cody and Dylan created NetSky AI—a straightforward, powerful AI email assistant that enables users to get the most out of their inbox with minimal effort.\n\n\n\nNetSky AI brings powerful automation into your inbox.
